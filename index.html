        I don’t even know where to begin when it comes to you, because what you’ve given me over this past year is something I can never properly measure.<br><br>

Your love has been my calm in chaos, my strength on the days I felt weak, and my reminder that I am never alone. The way you support me, believe in me, and stand beside me even when I doubt myself means more than I can ever explain. You don’t just love me when it’s easy or when I’m at my best, you love me through my moods, my stress, my overthinking, and everything in between. That kind of love is rare, and I see it, I feel it, and I cherish it every single day.<br><br>

We’ve had our small fights this year, those little misunderstandings and moments where emotions took over. But when I look back at them now, I don’t see distance, I see growth. Every argument taught us something. Every disagreement made us understand each other a little deeper. Instead of breaking us, they shaped us. We learned how to listen better, how to be patient, and how to choose each other even when pride tried to get in the way. That is what makes our love real and strong.<br><br>

Your care shows in the smallest details. The way you check on me, the way you notice when something is wrong even if I say I am fine, the way you remind me to take care of myself. Even from a distance, you manage to hold my heart so gently. You celebrate my wins like they are your own, and when I fall, you are the first one trying to lift me back up. That kind of care builds something lasting.<br><br>

This year with you has been about growing together. Through the laughs, the late night talks, the silly moments, and even the tears, we have become stronger. Thank you for loving me, supporting me, and choosing us every single day. I see your effort, I value your heart, and I am proud of the love we are building together.

      I don’t know what the future holds, but I know one thing for sure ,I want you in it.<br>

Stay with me through the good days and the hard ones. Let’s keep fighting for us, keep loving each other, and keep believing in the dream we’ve talked about so many times.<br>

Let’s close this distance one day, hold each other for real, and build the life we’ve imagined together.<br>

Choose me, like I will always choose you. Forever🥹❤️

            Even if this picture is AI generated,<br>
            the dream behind it is not.<br>

            It’s the future I imagine <br>
            standing next to you,<br>
            not through a screen,<br>
            but in real life.<br>

            We’ve handled distance.<br>
            We’ve handled small fights.<br>
            We’ve handled growth.<br>

            Now I just want to spend my whole life with you.<br>

            Stay with me.<br>
            Let’s make this our real story.
