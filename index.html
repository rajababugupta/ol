        I don’t even know where to begin when it comes to you, because what you’ve given me over this past year is something I can never properly measure. Your love has been my calm in chaos, my strength on the days I felt weak, and my reminder that I am never alone. The way you support me, believe in me, and stand beside me even when I doubt myself means more than I can ever explain. You don’t just love me when it’s easy or when I’m at my best, you love me through my moods, my stress, my overthinking, and everything in between. That kind of love is rare, and I see it, I feel it, and I cherish it every single day.

We’ve had our small fights this year, those little misunderstandings and moments where emotions took over. But when I look back at them now, I don’t see distance, I see growth. Every argument taught us something. Every disagreement made us understand each other a little deeper. Instead of breaking us, they shaped us. We learned how to listen better, how to be patient, how to choose each other even when pride tried to get in the way. And that’s what makes our love real. Not perfect, not always smooth, but strong, honest, and willing to fight for us.

Your care is something I feel in the smallest details. The way you check on me, the way you notice when something is wrong even if I say I’m fine, the way you remind me to take care of myself. You have this quiet way of loving that makes me feel safe. Even from a distance, you manage to hold my heart so gently. You celebrate my wins like they’re your own, and when I fall, you’re the first one trying to lift me back up. That kind of care isn’t loud, but it’s powerful. It’s the kind that builds a future.

This year with you has not just been about love, it has been about building something meaningful. We are learning each other’s flaws and still choosing to stay. We are figuring things out together. We are growing, sometimes slowly, sometimes through challenges, but always side by side. And when I think about everything we’ve been through, the laughs, the late night talks, the silly moments, even the tears, I realize how much stronger we’ve become.

I am grateful for you in ways words cannot fully capture. Thank you for loving me the way you do, for caring for me the way you do, and for choosing us every single day. No matter what comes next, I want you to know that I see your effort, I value your heart, and I am proud of the love we are building together.
